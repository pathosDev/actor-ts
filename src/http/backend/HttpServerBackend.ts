 * route off below its own configured cap, which is a silent wrong answer,
 * while the widest merely leaves a stricter route's surplus frames to the
 * connection actor — which refuses them with a clean 1009 exactly as it did
 * before this existed.
 *
 * What this buys is the part that was missing: the number is now the
 * application's, so *lowering* `maxFrameBytes` (per route or in HOCON) really
 * does narrow the buffering window, and raising it above 1 MiB is no longer
 * silently undone by the transport.
