 * Per-call options for any `SnapshotStore` / `DurableStateStore`
 * operation — primarily a way for an actor to declare its **own**
 * compression / encryption preferences, overriding any plugin-level
 * defaults.  Threaded through both write and read paths because
 * client-side encryption needs the master key on both sides (the store
 * has no other way to derive the per-pid subkey).  Compression on the
 * read side is informational only — the body-codec recovers it from the
 * payload header — and stores ignore it there.
 *
 * The two backing types (`CompressionConfig`, `EncryptionConfig`) are
 * defined here, at the persistence-layer top level, rather than inside
 * `object-storage/`.  The reason: actors don't know which concrete
 * store is wired up, and we don't want them to import from a specific
 * impl directory just to declare their own settings.  Stores that
 * don't honour these options (in-memory, SQLite, Cassandra) simply
 * ignore them.
