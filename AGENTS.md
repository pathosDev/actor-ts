# AGENTS.md — working standards for actor-ts

Standards for anyone (human or coding agent) making changes in this
repo. Read this before you start. These are conventions the project
already follows; keep them consistent.

## Project snapshot

`actor-ts` is a **pre-1.0** actor-model framework for TypeScript that
runs on **Bun, Node.js (≥ 20), and Deno**. ESM throughout; **Bun** is
the primary toolchain (`bun test`, `bunx tsc`). Runtime dependencies are
deliberately tiny — `fastify` + `ts-pattern` — and everything else
(Express, Hono, `ws`, brokers, SQL/Cassandra drivers, S3, …) is an
**optional peer dependency**, lazy-loaded on demand.

## Commit strategy

- **Conventional Commits**: `type(scope): subject`. Types in use:
  `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `chore`, `docs`, `test`, `ci`, `build`.
  Scope is the module/area, e.g. `http`, `http/ws`, `io`,
  `persistence/postgres`, `testkit`, `cluster`, `deps`, `deps-dev`,
  `readme`, `changelog`, `roadmap`, `integration`.
- **Small, focused commits.** Each commit should keep
  `bun run typecheck` + `bun test` green — so a bisect never lands on a
  broken tree.
- The **body explains what + why** (and the mechanics for non-trivial
  changes). Reference issues as `#NNN`; close them with `Closes #NNN`
  (see *Issues & workflow*).
- Commits that only touch CI-maintained artifacts (e.g. the README
  test/coverage badges) use `[skip ci]`.

## Branches & pushing

- **Feature branches** (`feat/…`, `fix/…`, `chore/…`) for features and
  anything non-trivial. Small fixes and follow-ups may go **directly on
  `main`**.
- Merge to `main` with a **merge commit (`git merge --no-ff`)** —
  **never rebase**. Delete the branch after merging.
- **Do not push.** The agent commits locally only; the human pushes
  `main`. The single exception is cutting a release (below), where
  creating the tag/GitHub Release is explicitly authorized.

## Release strategy

SemVer, and the project is **pre-1.0**:

- **patch `0.x.Y`** — bug fixes only, no breaking changes.
- **minor `0.X.0`** — new features; **may include breaking changes**.
- **`1.0.0`** — the API-stability commitment.

Tags are `vX.Y.Z`; 0.x GitHub Releases are flagged *pre-release*.

**CHANGELOG** (`CHANGELOG.md`) follows *Keep a Changelog*: an
`[Unreleased]` section with `Added` / `Changed` / `Fixed` / `Removed` /
`Security` subsections. **Breaking changes are flagged prominently**
(a `BREAKING` marker + a short migration note). Reference issues as
`#NNN`.

**Cutting a release** (only when explicitly asked):

1. Bump `version` in `package.json`.
2. Move `[Unreleased]` → `[X.Y.Z]` (dated) in `CHANGELOG.md`.
3. `gh release create vX.Y.Z` with **emoji-sectioned notes**
   (`## ✨ Added`, `## 🐛 Fixed`, `## 🔒 Security`, …) matching the
   style of prior releases.

Publishing the release triggers `.github/workflows/publish.yml`, which
runs typecheck + test + build and then `npm publish --provenance` via
**npm Trusted Publishing (OIDC)** — no long-lived token. It is
version-guarded, so re-running is safe. Locally, `prepublishOnly` runs
clean + build + typecheck + test.

## Breaking changes

**Pre-1.0, a hard cut is fine.** Remove or replace an API directly — no
deprecation cycle is required. Flag it as **BREAKING** in the CHANGELOG
with a one-line migration note, and update every in-repo caller
(examples, tests, docs) in the same change. (Post-1.0 this tightens to
conservative SemVer.) See `docs/.../reference/version-policy.mdx`.

## Documentation (all languages)

- Docs are **Starlight MDX** under `docs/src/content/docs/` (English),
  mirrored **1:1** under `docs/src/content/docs/de/` (German). **Every
  content change updates BOTH languages** — code samples stay identical,
  prose is translated. The `i18n` label tracks translation work.
- Feature or behavior changes also update **`README.md`** and
  **`CHANGELOG.md`**.
- Adding a page: keep `docs/scripts/scaffold.mjs` and the Astro sidebar
  (`docs/astro.config.mjs`) in sync — same path and label.

## Verification gates (before every commit)

- **`bun run typecheck`** (build tsconfig — excludes `examples/` and
  `tests/`) passes. `bun run typecheck:dev` additionally checks those.
- **`bun test`** is green. Line coverage floor is **≥ 80 %** —
  `bun run test:coverage:gate`.
- **Cross-runtime:** `bun run smoke` runs `tests/smoke/cases/*.mjs` on
  Bun, Node, and Deno. Add a smoke case for anything runtime-sensitive.
- **Don't hand-edit** the README test/coverage badges — CI updates them
  on push to `main`.

## Runtime portability

- Code must run on **Bun, Node ≥ 20, and Deno**. Runtime-specific
  primitives (HTTP serve, sockets, workers, SQLite, …) live behind small
  abstractions in **`src/runtime/`** and auto-detect at startup.
- **Optional peer dependencies:** `import()` them lazily with a clear
  *"install it with `bun add …`"* error on failure. Declare them in
  `peerDependencies` **and** `peerDependenciesMeta.<pkg>.optional = true`,
  and add a matching `devDependency` so the test suite can exercise them.

## Code style

- **Strict TypeScript.** ESM with the **`.js` import suffix** on
  relative imports (required by the build's module resolution).
- Discriminated-union handling via **`ts-pattern`**
  (`match(x).with(…).exhaustive()`).
- HOCON config keys go through **`src/config/ConfigKeys.ts`** (typed,
  single source of truth). Settings resolve with precedence:
  **explicit options > HOCON > built-in defaults**.
- **JSDoc explains the *why*** — constraints, rationale, non-obvious
  trade-offs — not a restatement of the code. Match the surrounding
  comment density; no narration or noise.

### Options & settings

- **Every configurable thing has a fluent options builder** —
  `XOptions.create().withField(…)`, extending `OptionsBuilder<T>` (broker
  actors via `BrokerOptions<T>`). Naming lockstep with **no divergence**:
  builder method `withX` ⇔ settings field `x` ⇔ HOCON leaf `x` (e.g.
  `withQos` ⇔ `qos`, never `defaultQos`). Multi-arg sugar is fine when the
  field still matches the stem (`withCredentials(u, p)` → field
  `credentials`; `withCircuitBreaker(f, r)` → field `circuitBreaker`).
- **Builder classes live in their own `XOptions.ts` file**, next to (never
  inside) the functional class they configure. The settings interface
  `XSettings` stays with the functional class (it's the config contract
  read by `readSettingsFromConfig`); `XOptions.ts` imports it type-only.
- **Consumers accept `XOptions | Partial<XSettings>`** and normalize with
  `resolveSettings(...)` from `src/util/OptionsBuilder.ts`. A plain settings
  object is fully interchangeable with the builder (it uses the settings
  field names).
- **Builder-first is the documented/primary style** — docs and examples
  show the builder; the plain object is the shorthand alternative (mention
  it once per page, don't lead with it).
- **Never nest a builder into a call** — always assign it to its own
  contextual local variable first (`const mqttOptions = MqttOptions
  .create()…; new MqttActor(mqttOptions)`), then pass the variable.
- **Write builder chains multi-line** — one `.withX()` per line (never a
  single-line chain), even short ones.
- **HOCON precedence is unchanged** — the builder / plain object feeds only
  the highest-precedence explicit layer; unset fields fall through to
  HOCON, then built-in defaults.

## Issues & workflow

- **Issue-first.** Before starting work, check for an existing issue
  (`gh issue list`, or search the tracker). If one exists, work against
  it and take its discussion into account. If none exists, **open one
  first** — for traceability — using the matching template in
  `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/` (bug / feature / documentation / security).
- **Close via the commit body:** when the work lands, close the issue
  with a `Closes #NNN` (or `Fixes #NNN`) line in the commit body. (It
  resolves once the commit reaches `main` on push.)
- Open an issue before non-trivial work to align on the approach first.

## Labels & security

- Label taxonomy: `priority: {high,medium,low}`,
  `severity: {critical,high,medium,low}`, `security`, `i18n`,
  `infrastructure`, `dependencies`, plus the standard `bug` /
  `enhancement` / `documentation`. Audit-catalog items use the title
  prefixes `[Security] ` / `[Feature] `.
- **Security-first posture:** cap untrusted input (e.g. WebSocket /
  wire-frame size limits), never trust client-supplied integrity fields,
  use crypto-grade randomness for wire identifiers. A security-relevant
  change gets a `Security` CHANGELOG entry and a `severity:` label.
